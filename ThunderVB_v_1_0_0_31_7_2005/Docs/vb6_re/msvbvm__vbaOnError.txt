Function :
__imp____vbaOnError : set error handling mode 

params : 1 , int 32 bit signed , seems to be an enum

enum vbaOnError_mode 
	resume_next=-1
	goto_0=0
	goto_labelx=x where x is diferent than 0 and it is positive 
end enum

-how seh works on vb ?
well , it is simple *couh*

Here is what i know so far:
vb keeps some structures for every function that has exeption handling
handlers.The info contains a list with label to all lines (vb code lines)
a list with labels to error handler and more.For more info look HowSehWorks_diss.txt
it is a listing of a simple sub main , comented and with labels renamed

-Why code using Error handling is slooowww?
Hmm , that's a good one :
a) Because of vb error handling way the compiler cannot optimise your code betwen lines (heh..).
   This means that things even the simplest optimisations (like register caching) can't be done ;)

b) Because of vb error handling way for each line that executes there is some overhead , usualy 
   small..

solutions:

Avoid using for loops with error hnadling .. i don't know but it could be possible that the
index will be regcached if not using error handling (maby not :P).Generaly avoid using code
that repeats with error handling.

..Use an other compiler :P
