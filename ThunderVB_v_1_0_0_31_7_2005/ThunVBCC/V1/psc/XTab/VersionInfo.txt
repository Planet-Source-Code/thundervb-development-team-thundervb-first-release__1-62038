Version 	:	1.1.1
Released on	:	9th Jan 2005
Changes		:
		 1) Added a method called "CopyTabImagesFromImageList()" which can be called at
	            runtime to copy images from an Image List or compatible control into the tabs
                    (will find a better way to do so in future release(s)), Based
                    on a request by: Mr. Mel Reyes
BugFixes	:
	         1) Bug Reported by: Bob Churchill
	            When Multiple forms containing XTab are unloaded **sometimes** we get
        	    a "Client Side Not Available" error.
	            For more details about the error please contact me.
	            Solution: This happens sometimes because the control gets a "GotFocus" event
	            When the form is unloaded. This is strange behaviour and the Ambient object
	            becomes unavailable. To solve this I had to check for Ambient Object before usin it.

	            Thanks Bob for reporting the bug

Version 	:	1.0.1
Released on	:	5th Oct 2004
BugFixes	:
	         1)	Bug Reported by: Maurice
		        Creating an exe with the control in XP and using a Manifest file
		        causes a General Protection Fault "after" exiting the application.
		        This is not a problem with the control, but with the ComCtl32.dll
		        version of XP. This problem occurs even if u have no code at all in
		        the user cotrol. For more details about the error please contact me.
